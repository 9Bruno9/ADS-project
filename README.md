# ADS-project
Exam project for the Advanced Data Science course in the Master's degree program in Computer Science at the University of Udine. Academic year 2024-2025.

- datasets are too big for github. They can be downloaded at https://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/en/bdd_modele/bdd_modele_item.asp?id=37. I used data of 1999, 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 (the most recent version for each one). You can also find it on https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1_7vdMbaIbz1Kpz4WEpkpHEsX8AGfp4Mq?q=sharedwith:public%20parent:1_7vdMbaIbz1Kpz4WEpkpHEsX8AGfp4Mq
- main_examAds_BACI.R contains the code about cleaning and trasforming dataset in useful data-frames
- ProjectEsameADS.pdf contains the explanation of the code and all the analysis.
